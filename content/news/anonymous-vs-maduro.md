### What's happening in Venezuela

After the last elections that occurred on July 28 of this year, and after the dispute between the legitimacy of the results, the hacker activist group Anonymous has launched severe attacks on more than 300 Venezuelan government websites and according to recent news seen in Elon Musk's X platform, from one of the accounts of this group it was also announced that a large database in the country was hacked. Obtaining personal data from high-ranking officials in the military leadership and, according to the activist group, also sensitive information and videos that could strongly compromise the Nicolas Maduro regime.

The altercation began after statements made by Nicolas Maduro alleging that the minutes could not be delivered to the international committee since hackers had corrupted them and were impossible to recover.

This unleashed the fury of many people who claimed that these ballots were impossible to corrupt since they were linked to a QR code that stored all the necessary information in a database and that they had a unique key to access them. This key that is talked about in the media, according to computer experts, could not be altered or changed.

### Anonymous comes into play

In response to these statements from the government of Venezuela and adding to the actions that occurred after the people went out to protest in the streets where they were persecuted and there were even deaths among the protesters.

The Anonymous group began a direct attack on servers, websites and even a Venezuelan airline, thus declaring war on the Venezuelan government controlled today by the Maduro regime.

These activists support their actions by stating that Maduro is a tyrannical dictator who has the Venezuelan people under a blanket of terror and misery and that they will not allow such an aberration against the Venezuelan people to continue occurring.

In an era where everything is connected every day it is more common to see how battles are not only fought in the streets but also one of the key elements for victory is through information technology and the Internet. 

Whether what the Anonymous group is doing is right or not will depend on each individual. As an ethical hacker I always have in mind a phrase that many mentors have told me.
