### What's happening in Venezuela

**On July 28, 2024, the presidential elections were held in Venezuela, a country that has a long history of corruption and poverty**.

In this country, *the socialism has been in power for a long time*...and why is this? to the people's desire to remain in the hands of an ideology that only drives them deeper into poverty, or is it impossible for them, with the tools they have, to *free* themselves from this tyrannical regime?

Well, clearly due to the rebellions that have been seen in recent weeks in the region, it does not seem that the people are happy with the government led by Nicolas Maduro. But *what can be done against a government that controls the armed forces, the judges and has an entourage of thugs at its disposal?* Well, taking the streets to protest was not the answer since many people have been arrested, murdered or disappeared for demanding a fair election.

And why do I refer to this as a unfair election and *what does all this have to do with hacktivism?* Well, let me tell you that among all the nonsense that has been said by the ruling government, one of them was that *the ballots used to vote in Venezuela have been hacked and therefore cannot be shown*, they have been lost or corrupted, Who knows what really happened?

**But the truth is that those ballots which have an electronic record and are stored in a database are very difficult to hack since they have a unique key that cannot be changed to access them. So what happened to the ballots that have not been shown to date by the government led by Maduro?**

On the other hand, *the opposition was very clever on this occasion since they kept in a private registry* far from the clutches of the national government all the minutes with each vote of all citizens, *since this type of response from Maduro is expected if results were given unfavorable for him*.

Now the problem comes with the fact that the Maduro regime has too much power in Venezuela and simply having the people take to the streets to protest is not enough. Something else is missing, *that push is missing to help an entire country get out of a tyranny that has been established in it for decades.*

### Anonymous comes into play

This is where the band of *international hackers Anonymous* comes in, already known for their incredible feats against different human interests, such as fighting with the Church of Scientology to getting involved in the Wikileaks problem where Julian Assange and Edward Snowden were involved.
*This group of hackers is considered one of the most dangerous since their way of operating is decentralized and that makes them more difficult for governments to track.*

But getting to the point, in recent days numerous videos have been released by the Anonymous organization declaring war on Maduro and his tyrannical reign. *They have managed to hack more than 235 official websites of the Venezuelan government* and the latest news is that they *leaked confidential information from the high and medium military officials who are in charge of the persecution of the opponents* (citizens who come out to complain), *they also claim to have access to a database where they have found valuable information (documents and videos) that compromise the government of Nicolas Maduro*.

And it is at this point where we ask ourselves... Is it bad to be a hacker who, using his knowledge, manages to help others in a fight that, without that striking force, is very likely to be lost?

### Is Hactivism a good idea?

*Extracting personal data, documents, videos or anything that does not belong to us is wrong*, that is more than clear, but *is it okay to carry out attacks like this on people who are bad, that hurt people and perpetuate their power through terror and death?* Well, it is a complicated question that has, like a coin, two sides, two answers.

*I am going to base the first answer on the principles of ethical hacking*, white hat hackers, who know very well that the computer knowledge that we learn throughout our life as computer security agents must be used responsibly and only with the necessary permissions. Thus marking a scope for our penetration tasks previously agreed upon with whoever hired us. And no matter how much our blood boils or our heart cries out for something beyond what we can do, we must remain calm and be professional.

>"With great power comes great responsibility"

*My second answer is based more on the ideological principles that a person can take*, understanding well the difference between good and evil, what is ethical and not ethical.

Many times in life we ​​overlook injustices that for our life are insignificant and not they represent nothing. But what happens when we see an injustice that affects not only the lives of others but also our own, an injustice that can alter the course of life as we know it?

And it is there where hacktivists are born, people with a great sense of justice and with the necessary courage to carry out those acts that are prohibited under global or national laws. Accepting all responsibility with the courage of a great warrior. That is why I consider that the Anonymous group is not a criminal but a hero in this battle against the dictatorship carried out by Nicolas Maduro against the Venezuelan people, because you fight fire with fire!

*But in this case the intervention of the Anonymous group could be a double-edged sword*, since the Maduro government *could use their actions as a shield to perpetuate its plans*, claiming that this group is controlled by the United States and that they respond to their orders. Making it clear that the intentions of the latter are not to save the people of Venezuela but to keep the resources of the same.

We will have to wait to see what happens with the latter and to be aware of new news.
